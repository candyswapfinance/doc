## ![](../.gitbook/assets/exchange.png)The basics

Candy swap is a feature to seamlessly swap tokens instantly without a centralized Order Book like in traditional centralized exchanges for a tiny fee.&#x20;

Users pay a 0.3% trading fee that is shared between the Liquidity Providers and the CandySwap platform.
