# What is an AMM Protocol?

**AMM:** CandySwap is an Automated Market Maker Decentralized Exchange.

In short, there are no middle man or order books like a traditional centralized exchange.

Our users trade about Smart Contracts which leverage liquidity/assets provided by Liquidity Providers.

In order for CandySwap to be an autonomous finance ecosystem, we have fine-tuned our Token Economics to offer incentives for all parties involved in order to foster the long-term sustainability and thriving of the platform.&#x20;

The more users and supporters, the more network effect will drive up the value for everyone.&#x20;

We sincerely thank you for your support!
